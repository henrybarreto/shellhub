# ShellHub [![ShellHub](https://circleci.com/gh/shellhub-io/shellhub.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/shellhub-io/shellhub)

ShellHub is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing Linux devices
via command line (using any SSH client) or web-based user interface.
It is intended to be used instead of sshd. ShellHub enables teams to
easily access any Linux device behind firewall and NAT.
